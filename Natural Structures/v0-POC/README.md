# Natural Structure Demo
This demo shows how we can simulate the development and adaptation of dynamic structures, similar to trees and mycelium propagation
Utilizing some swarm rules:
1. Node spacing
2. Node's purpose's efficiency
The above rules has visually obvious results when organizing nodes, as well as estabilishing the general structure and connections of each node.
